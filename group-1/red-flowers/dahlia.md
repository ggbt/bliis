# Dahlia

Hey Doctor take my temperature\
Think I've got a fever

\
Why Doctor you make me feel worse\
Your touch raises my pressure

\
Blooms\
It blooms\
The seed that you left inside\
It blooms\
No need for air or sunlight\
It blooms\
With my blood it stays alive\
It blooms\
And blooms\
And blooms

\
My soil is spread\
Before your eyes\
Look at me\
Don't you see?\
Your Dahlia has flowered

\
Blooms\
It blooms\
The secret garden serenades\
Germinates\
Florets turn bright red\
Lulila lila lulila\
Smile at me\
Smile at me endlessly

\
Separate me in half\
So the Doctor can stitch me back up again\
Separate me in half\
Prosper my dear Dahlia

\
Blooms\
It blooms\
The Dahlia blooms\
It blooms\
It blooms\
The Dahlia withers and droop\
Then blooms\
And blooms\
Forever it blooms\
And dies\
And blooms\
Silently it blooms
